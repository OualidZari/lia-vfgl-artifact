\section{Introduction}
This document provides detailed instructions for reproducing the main results of the paper "Link Inference Attack in Vertical Federated Graph Learning". The artifacts are hosted on \href{https://osf.io/link-to-artifacts}{OSF} and include all necessary code, datasets, and scripts to replicate our experiments. This documentation is structured as follows: Section 2 outlines the file directory, Section 3 provides step-by-step guidelines to reproduce results, Section 4 offers additional information, and Section 5 describes supplementary materials.

\section{File Directory}
\begin{longtable}{p{0.3\textwidth}p{0.7\textwidth}}
\toprule
File/Directory Name & Description \\
\midrule
\texttt{setup\_lia\_vfgl.sh} & Shell script for setting up the environment and installing required libraries \\
\texttt{requirements.txt} & List of required Python libraries and their versions \\
\texttt{scripts/} & Directory containing experiment scripts \\
\texttt{scripts/run\_figure4.sh} & Script to reproduce Figure 4 results \\
\texttt{log/} & Directory where experiment logs are stored \\
\texttt{reproduced-results/} & Directory containing Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for parsing logs and producing final results \\
\texttt{reproduced-results/figure4.py} & Python script to generate Figure 4 from log data \\
\texttt{download\_datasets.py} & Script to download required datasets \\

\section{Guideline to Reproduce Results}
Estimated time for reproduction varies by dataset:
\begin{itemize}
\item Cora and Citeseer: 3 minutes
\item Amazon Photo: 22 minutes
\item Amazon Computer: 77 minutes
\item Twitch FR: 30 minutes
\item Twitch DE: 55 minutes
\item Twitch EN: 30 minutes
\end{itemize}

These estimates are for 5 parallel runs on our primary hardware setup.

\subsection{Step-by-step instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Access and download artifacts from the \href{https://osf.io/link-to-artifacts}{OSF repository}.

\item Set up the environment:
   \begin{verbatim}
   ./setup_lia_vfgl.sh
   source lia_vfgl_env/bin/activate
   \end{verbatim}

\item To reproduce Figure 4 results:
   \begin{verbatim}
   cd scripts
   ./run_figure4.sh
   \end{verbatim}

\item Generate the figure:
   \begin{verbatim}
   cd ../reproduced-results
   python figure4.py
   \end{verbatim}

\item The output figure will be saved as \texttt{feature\_ratio\_comparison\_cora.pdf} in the \texttt{reproduced-results} directory.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Additional Information}
For questions or issues, please contact [Your Contact Information].

\textbf{Hardware Requirements:} Our primary setup used 4x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs, AMD EPYC 7272 12-Core Processor, 125GB RAM, and Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS. However, Cora dataset experiments can run on smaller setups without a GPU.

\section{Supplementary Materials}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{download\_datasets.py}: Script to download all datasets used in the paper.
\item Jupyter notebooks in \texttt{reproduced-results/}: Provide an interactive way to parse logs and produce final results for each experiment.
\end{itemize}
